 The DOM Based Game


https://iamhenrika.github.io/Project-One/


For my very first try at creating a web-based game using DOM manipulation, Iâ€™m attempting a Simon (Says) game.

The game will feature HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components.

I will also integrate a timer function.

*Extra extra: I will try to to make this a multi-player turn-based game.
